# OceanCache
**Geospatial Decision-Support System for Maritime Container Recovery Operations**

OceanCache provides salvage operators and maritime logistics entities with a probability-weighted search optimization framework for lost cargo containers. The system renders a multi-layered heatmap visualization over an interactive 3D bathymetric mesh, leveraging rule-based spatial analysis derived from last-known positional telemetry, vessel trajectory proximity, and historical incident clustering.

This represents a proof-of-concept implementation: data inputs are synthetically generated, but the operational workflow adheres to industry-standard recovery protocols and maintains demonstration viability.
