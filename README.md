# OceanCache
**Geospatial Decision-Support System for Maritime Container Recovery Operations**

OceanCache provides salvage operators and maritime logistics entities with a probability-weighted search optimization framework for lost cargo containers. The system renders a multi-layered heatmap visualization over an interactive 3D bathymetric mesh, leveraging rule-based spatial analysis derived from last-known positional telemetry, vessel trajectory proximity, and historical incident clustering.

This represents a proof-of-concept implementation: data inputs are synthetically generated, but the operational workflow adheres to industry-standard recovery protocols and maintains demonstration viability.

## Problem
Maritime container loss incidents result in significant operational expenditure and extended recovery timelines. Current search methodologies employ broad-radius scanning patterns centered on last-known coordinates, yielding suboptimal resource allocation and inflated operational costs due to excessive search area coverage.
